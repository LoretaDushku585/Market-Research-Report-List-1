<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ophthalmic Lens Coating Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dip Coating</li><li>Spin Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ophthalmic lens coating equipment market includes primarily two types: dip coating and spin coating. Dip coating involves immersing lenses in a liquid coating solution, allowing for uniform application through gravity and surface tension. This method is suitable for thicker layers and large batches. In contrast, spin coating applies a thin, even layer by spinning the lens at high speeds, which disperses the coating evenly across the surface. Both techniques are essential for enhancing lens durability, scratch resistance, and optical performance.</p></p>
