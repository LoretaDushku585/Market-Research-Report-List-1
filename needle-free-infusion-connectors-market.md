<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Needle-free Infusion Connectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure</li><li>Non Positive Pressure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The needle-free infusion connectors market is categorized into two main types: positive pressure and non-positive pressure systems. Positive pressure connectors require the infusion line to maintain pressure during disconnection, minimizing air contamination and blood reflux. This design enhances safety and reduces the risk of complications. In contrast, non-positive pressure connectors allow fluid flow without maintaining pressure, simplifying use but potentially increasing risk of air entry or backflow. Both types aim to enhance patient safety and streamline IV therapy procedures.</p></p>
